<h1>CORPORATE IDENTITY</h1>
<p>
<b>Name etymology</b>
Xiaomi (小米) is the Chinese word for "millet".[112] In 2011 its CEO Lei Jun suggested there are more meanings than just the "millet and rice".[113] He linked the "Xiao" (小) part to the Buddhist concept that "a single grain of rice of a Buddhist is as great as a mountain",[114] suggesting that Xiaomi wants to work from the little things, instead of starting by striving for perfection,[113] while "mi" (米) is an acronym for Mobile Internet and also "mission impossible", referring to the obstacles encountered in starting the company.

  He also stated that he thinks the name is cute.[113] In 2012 Lei Jun said that the name is about revolution and being able to bring innovation into a new area.[116] Xiaomi's new "Rifle" processor[117] has given weight to several sources linking the latter meaning to the Communist Party of China's "millet and rifle" (小米加步枪) revolutionary idiom[118][119] during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

<b>Logo and mascot</b>
Xiaomi's first logo consisted of a single orange square with the letters "MI" in white located in the center of the square. This logo was in use until 31 March 2021, when a new logo, designed by well-known Japanese designer Kenya Hara, replaced the old one, consisting of the same basic structure as the previous logo, but the square was replaced with a "squircle" with rounded corners instead, with the letters "MI" remaining identical to the previous logo, along with a slightly darker hue.

Xiaomi's mascot, Mitu, is a white rabbit wearing an Ushanka (known locally as a "Lei Feng hat" in China) with a red star and a red scarf around its neck.[124][125] Later on, the red star on the hat was replaced by the company's logo.[126]
